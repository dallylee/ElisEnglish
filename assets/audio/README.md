# Audio Files

This folder contains audio files for vocabulary words and voice lessons.

## File Naming Convention

Name audio files to match their vocabulary ID from lesson files:
- `hello.mp3` for vocabulary with id "hello"
- `goodbye.mp3` for vocabulary with id "goodbye"
- etc.

## Audio Format

Supported formats:
- MP3 (recommended)
- WAV
- OGG

## Creating Audio Files

You can create audio files by:

1. **Recording yourself**: Use any audio recording software
2. **Text-to-Speech tools**: Use online TTS services like:
   - Google Cloud Text-to-Speech
   - Amazon Polly
   - Microsoft Azure TTS
3. **Professional voice actors**: For higher quality

## Audio Settings

Recommended settings for vocabulary audio:
- Sample rate: 44.1 kHz
- Bit rate: 128-192 kbps
